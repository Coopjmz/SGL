# SGL
A simple, yet effective, C++ library that makes writing OpenGL code easier and less cumbersome by abstracting the repetitive boilerplate code away.

## Installation
1. Download the repository.
2. Depending on your OS and IDE, run the corresponding script in the [scripts](https://github.com/Coopjmz/SGL/tree/main/scripts) folder.
3. Build and run the project.
4. If you decide to run the executable manually, you can find it in the binaries folder - `build\bin`. Copy the [res](https://github.com/Coopjmz/SGL/tree/main/SGL/res) folder and put it in the same directory as the executable.
